## THE PREMISE

###### ...

###### Concept and writing: Jason Hobbs

### BITE the BULLET

##### THE PREMISE

```
The world didn’t end with a bang. It just...dried up.
```
```
Crops failed. Governments and towns crumbled. That left gun smoke, a sharp word, and faith. Now it’s generations later.
People live in worn-out settlements, carry old-world iron, and cling to whatever beliefs that kept them breathing. Some say miracles still happen out here in the Wastes—but they’re fueled by something deeper, more internal, than bullets.
```
```
You’ve got grit, ghosts, and something you believe in that’s worth dying for. That's enough.
```

```

## CREATING A CHARACTER

##### CREATING A CHARACTER

```
Roll 3D6 for each attribute score, in the order shown below.
Ten (10) is an average score.
```
```
Vigor: Endurance, strength, reflexes, hardcore parkour
```
```
Presence: Charisma, mental tenacity, grace under pressure
```
```
Faith: Spiritual composure, manifested will, supernatural
```
```
Characters also start with 2d6 Sand. This represents how well they stave off death and “stick to their guns,” stay determined in the face of social adversity, or maintain their convictions. Sand acts as temporary morale, focus, and mental stamina. Sand usually fully recovers after each scene.
```
```
Roll (or choose on the tables below) your characteristics and detail these on your sheet. Characteristics are narrative traits that you can tap (use) during conflict. All characteristics start at Rank 1, but can be increased through play.
```
```
There are six characteristics:
```
○ Background—What you know, skills, lifestyle, experience.
○ Reputation—How others see you, earned or mistaken.
○ Fortitude—What anchors or drives you: a code, principle, or guiding truth.
○ Foible—Flaws, compulsions, or emotional scars that shape your actions.
○ Issue—Your burden, obsession, or flaw that causes tension.
○ The Bond—What ties your band together (this is described in a later section).
```
##### Using Characteristics

You can use (“tap”) any of your characteristics to mitigate damage, to increase damage in conflict, or as a bonus for a Save. When you tap a characteristic, add its rank to your roll (or subtract it for a Save).
```
You can’t tap the same characteristic until you’ve used at least two others.
```
```
After ten uses, roll d6. If the result is higher than the current rank, increase that characteristic’s rank. If it is equal to or less than, you must use it ten more times. To go from Rank 2 to Rank 3 takes 20 uses before the roll is made, and then 20 more before the rank advancement can be attempted again. It takes 30 uses to advance from Rank 3 to Rank 4, etc.

##### Equipment

Roll once for your armor and weapon. Roll three times for your gear or pick which three suit you.

Your Inventory is equal to your Vigor (or 10 if that’s higher).
The total Slot value of your items and status effects is your Load. Subtract Load from Inventory to find your Reserve.
Reserve is used for advanced conflict options, Faith-based actions, and character status effects.

```
ARMOR
```
Armor mitigates damage. If it applies, subtract the armor value from the damage caused.

- Characteristics can be used to further reduce damage.

**d5 Result Armor Slots Description**

**1** Duster coat 1 1 Worn leather, oil-waxed for trail grit. Light but better than nothing.
**2** Rancher’s vest 2 1 Thick quilted leather layered with scraps of metal or bone. Uncomfortable but sturdy.
**3** Railhand plate 2 2 Salvaged breastplate from a collapsed ironclad engine. Heavy and clumsy, but solid.
**4** Scavver leathers 1 1 Patchwork hides, reinforced with wire mesh and thick canvas. Worn by dust-pickers.
**5** Bone-ward fetish 0 0 No protection to speak of, but hung with charms, bones, or glyphs. May ward off fear or stranger things. Could be armor for Faith-based conflict.



##### Money and Lead

If you rolled a firearm or bow, take 1d4+1 Lead as backup (all your Lead takes up 1 slot). Using one Lead refills your weapon but doesn’t reduce Inventory slots until it’s used up.

In addition, take 1d6 in coin and foldable bills (no slots). If you acquire enough loot, it might require a slot or two.

## CONFLICTS CONFLICTS

There are three types of conflict: Physical, Social, and Faith.
Players act first in each round of conflict unless they are surprised. After the players act, their opponents act in turn, and then a new round begins. This continues until one side or the other is defeated, concedes, or is driven away.

##### Physical Conflict

1. Roll damage. If attacking with superior advantage, roll d12. If at disadvantage or unarmed, roll d4. Otherwise, roll your weapon’s damage.
    a. You can tap a characteristic to add its rank to the damage. Note its use on your character sheet.
2. Subtract physical armor from damage, if the armor applies.
    Guns ignore mundane armor.
3. If a characteristic applies, with or without armor, you can tap it to reduce the damage by its rank.
4. Apply the remaining damage to Sand.
    a. If Sand is reduced below zero, apply the remaining damage to Vigor and roll a Vigor Save.
    b. If Sand is reduced to zero,
       roll a Physical burden.

```
Saves
```
###### Roll a d20. If the result is equal to or under your attribute, you have succeeded. If it is above, you have failed and are rendered unconscious.

```
What is a physical conflict?
```
###### A physical conflict is one that involves an exchange of blows, blades, or bullets. You’re beating your opponents into submission. You win when they surrender, flee, or die.

###### ...

###### Inspired from: We Deal in Lead (Colin Le Sueur)


##### Social Conflict

What is a social conflict?

A social conflict is one that involves an exchange of words or emotions. It’s an argument or a test of will. You’re typically seeking a concession from the other side—something they can grant you. You win when they grant it.

1. Roll damage. A typical argument or advance is d6. One made weakly or at disadvantage is d4. A decisive ploy may be d10 or d12.
    a. You can tap a characteristic to add its rank to the damage. Note its use on your character sheet.
2. Subtract social armor from damage. Social armor includes things like attire, emblems, connections, and status.
3. If a characteristic applies, with or without armor, you can tap it to reduce the damage by its rank.
4. Apply the remaining damage to Sand.
    a. If Sand is reduced below zero, apply the remaining damage to Presence and roll a Presence Save.
    b. If Sand is reduced to zero, roll a Social burden.

```
What is a faith conflict?
```
A faith conflict involves tests of will, belief, and sanctity. It may not involve damage. Sometimes you’re seeking to banish or exorcise an entity. Sometimes you want to call down holy fire upon the unclean. You win when the entity you’re confronting is repelled, expelled, or capitulates.

##### Faith Conflict

Faith conflicts are slightly different. Acts of Faith require the use of Reserve—the difference between your Load (used-up slots) and your Inventory. The amount in your Reserve is the level of effect you can achieve.

1. Decide upon the effect and its Reserve requirement. You can only perform an Act of Faith if you have the Reserve.
2. Save against Faith, modified by the difficulty.
a. If you fail the Save, you sustain d6 damage for each level of Reserve required.
b. If you succeed, the effect occurs. Damage-based effects incur d6 per Reserve.
3. If a characteristic applies, with or without armor, you can tap it to reduce the damage by its rank.
4. Apply the remaining damage to Sand.
a. If Sand is reduced below zero, apply the remaining damage to Faith and roll a Faith Save.
b. If Sand is reduced to zero, roll a Faith burden.

##### Faith damage

If you fail a Faith Save when attempting an Act of Faith, you can tap a characteristic to reduce the damage.


###### Inspired from: Monolith (Adam Hensley)


## ACTS ACTSOF FAITH OF FAITH

Faith in Bite the Bullet is powerful, personal, and can create doubt. It reflects the strength of a character's conviction, their connection to old-world religion, animist spirits, or deeply felt codes of meaning.

Faith is not necessarily magic. It is will made manifest—if your spirit is strong, and your burden is light.

To attempt a Faith-based act, you must have the required Reserve. Your Reserve is not “spent” to achieve Acts of Faith. You only need to have enough Reserve to accomplish the act.

1. Narrate the intent and act (for example: a ritual, prayer, symbol, or offering).
2. Tap a Faith-linked characteristic. It’s possible an item could be used to help with this, too.
3. Ensure you have enough Reserve (based on the scale of the effect).
4. Roll a Faith Save modified by the scale of effect and your characteristic rank.
a. On a failure, the act does not occur. You suffer d damage for each Reserve point required to achieve the effect. You can mitigate this damage by tapping an alternate characteristic.
b. Success means the Act of Faith occurs.

###### Faith acts should feel meaningful and shouldn’t be used without understanding the risk.

**Scale Reserve Modifier Example effects**

Trivial 0 0 Light a candle, hear a whisper, feel a presence, mild omen
Minor 1 –1 Bless food, water, or people, calm fear, detect spirits, temporarily ward an area, boost SND
Moderate 2 –2 Heal attributes (d6), repel spirits, receive cryptic vision, sanctify a place, commune with dead
Major 3 –3 Banish an otherworldly creature, call down fire (d6 AoE), purge a soul, commune with power
Legendary 4+ Special Bring back from the grave, stop time, part a storm, rare and world-changing

- The modifier applies to the target number.
- Legendary miracles should be narrative turning points and may require specific locations

###### conditions, or offerings.

- The GM may further modify the difficulty based on: effects like distractions, fear, desecrated

###### or holy ground, past failures or successes.

##### Consequences of Failure

Instead of suffering damage on a failed Faith Save, the GM can alternatively apply a spiritual status. These are applied to a PCs Inventory and can be as bad, or worse, than damage.

Examples:

**○ Spiritual weight** (1 slot). Can't attempt Acts of Faith above Minor.
**○ Doubt.** Disadvantage on next Faith Save.
**○ Night terrors.** Can’t recover Resolve during next rest.
**○ Haunted.** Can’t tap a Characteristic for 1 session.

## BURDENS BURDENS & INJURY & INJURY

If your Sand is reduced to exactly zero, roll a burden for the type of conflict you were involved in (Physical, Social, or Faith). Burdens usually have temporary effects, but can offer character growth over the long term.

If you sustain damage greater than your Sand, apply the excess to the relevant attribute. When that happens, don’t roll a burden; make a Save instead: roll a d20 under your attribute after the damage is applied.

Attributes that are reduced to zero have the following effects:

○ Vigor – You’re dead
○ Presence – Paralyzed
○ Faith – Madness

```
Poisoned
```
A status effect that takes 1 slot. You can’t recover Sand when you’re poisoned and you suffer 1d4 attribute damage per day.

```
Deprived
```
A status effect that takes 1 slot due to dehydration, lack of rest, or fatigue. You can recover neither attribute damage nor Sand.

```
Status effects
```
A number of burdens cause status effects, which take up slots in your Inventory. Unless the burden description tells you how the effect can be removed, it can only be remedied through role-play at the GM’s discretion.

## REST REST & RECOVERY & RECOVERY

There are three types of rest: a short rest (breather), a long rest (a few days in town or in a hospitable location), and the campfire (special).

## Short Rest

A short rest restores all of your Sand. There are some statuses that can prevent this (for example, poisoned).

## Long Rest

A long rest heals 1 attribute point. You can also recover lost characteristics, reflect on your actions, and change gear.

## The Campfire

After a story arc, major event, or chapter, the band can use recovery time to have a campfire. At the campfire, each member of the band can share a memory, lesson, or reflection from recent events.

If what you share at the campfire meets the group’s approval, you can:

○ Rename one characteristic to a new one invented by the group, and restart that characteristic at rank 1.

○ Increase the rank of a characteristic by 1 while also lowering another characteristic by 1.

○ Heal a status effect that’s lingering in your inventory if it has no other remedy conditions.

##### THE BOND

Every band is tied together in some way: an ephemeral string of fate or need that holds them together against the odds, or striving for a unified goal. This is represented by a sixth characteristic called The Bond. The Bond can be used in special circumstances by any player in the band. The Bond can be rolled randomly on the tables below or chosen as prescribed by the GM.

The Bond, as a characteristic, can be:

○ Tapped by any player.
○ Only tapped again by that player after all other players have done so.

**d4 Bond type**

**1** The Pact. The band is bound by oath, vengeance, or common survival.
**2** The Ledger. Debts and favors bind you together.

**4** The Shared Burden. A common weight you all carry is lighter than one
carried alone.

###### PACT BONDS

**d6 Pact bond**

**1** Sworn to avenge a town that was burned to ashes.
